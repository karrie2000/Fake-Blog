    <p>
      Hey yall! My name is Karrington Gatlin, and I'm passionate about creating
      spaces where people can connect and grow. With a deep admiration for the
      communication skills of Oprah and Larry King, I strive to emulate their
      ability to connect with others through meaningful conversations. I'm
      currently diving into the world of JavaScript, continuously honing my
      skills and exploring new ways to innovate.

                I enjoy hanging out with my friends at a movie review club we
                recently created. We watch movies and analyze how the director
                used storytelling and cinematography to depict the story. We
                then discuss how we would improve the movie.

                Pickleball is a very social sport, so I like to attend
                pickleball tournaments to make new friends and get some good
                exercise!

                I paint at least once a week to sharpen my creative skills and
                express my thoughts and emotions through visual art.

              <p>
                I'm not the best cook, but I try my best! I like to meal prep to
                better manage my time. I also push myself to cook meals from
                different cultures because I find that learning about other
                cultures through food connects me back to my own.

                I've been given many opportunities to succeed, so I volunteer at
                local humanitarian-based organizations to give back to my
                community and help those facing difficult life circumstances.
